# Predictive-Modeling-of-30-Day-Hospital-Readmissions-in-Cardiovascular-Patients-
Built a 30-day ICU readmission prediction model using MIMIC data. Engineered clinical features, created ICD-based comorbidity flags, handled class imbalance with SMOTE, and optimized the model threshold for recall. Utilized SQL scripts for supplemental data exploration.
